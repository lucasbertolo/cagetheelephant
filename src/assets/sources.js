    bio: `Bowling Green, Kentucky only has a population of 61,000. 
    It seems like a big number, but when you really look at it, it’s only 
    about 0.007% of the population in New York City. 
    It’s a tiny fraction of a percent. If you look up what the city is famous for, 
    it’s hard to find an answer. So when brothers Matt and Brad Shultz of Cage The Elephant 
    started writing their newest record, Tell Me I’m Pretty via RCA Records
    they went back to their hometown to spark some memories where everyone 
    knows everyone– especially their band.  <br>'At some point you have 
    to get the fuck out,' guitarist Brad Shultz said. 'There wasn’t anything to
    do in Bowling Green; a lot of kids get into bands. As far as the younger 
    generation and even generations above us like Government 
    Cheese and The Everly Brothers, Bowling Green was a little oasis.`,

    bio: `'COME A LITTLE CLOSER,' THE FIRST SINGLE FROM Cage The Elephant’s 
    third album, Melophobia, is steered by the powerful bass of Daniel Tichenor.
    His thick, muted picking on the song conveys all of the grittiness that is found 
    on the rest of the album, where Tichenor stands out with a variety of funky, 
    galloping, and driving bass riffs that hone the melody as a way to 
    move the song. It’s a surprising fact that Tichenor had never touched 
    a bass before joining this band, and it’s even more surprising to find 
    that a near death experience is what led him to join.<br><br>After moving to 
    Louisville, Kentucky at age 23, Tichenor had set out to make a name for 
    himself as a guitarist, when suddenly life took a vicious turn: A car 
    crashed into him at 45 miles per hour while he was in a crosswalk
    'to get home. With two shattered legs and a long road to recovery, 
    Tichenor returned home to Bowling Green, where Matthew and Brad Shultz asked 
    him to learn bass and join their band. Seven years later, Tichenor is supplying
    pocket lines on songs such as “Take It or Leave It” and “Halo” with the poise 
    of a seasoned veteran and the gratitude of a man given a second chance.`,

    bio: `'Matt grew up2 in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with his brother, Brad, who is 
a year older and also in Cage the Elephant. They came from a poor background and 
were sometimes teased for this. Brad was called 'Poor Boy' by kids at their school. 
Their dad, a musician, is also called Brad and their parents separated when the 
brothers ' + "were young. After the divorce, their mother dated Matt's football 
coach leading him to quit the team and play music in a state of rebellion;<br><br>  
Matt married his fiancé Juliette Buchs, French actress and model, at the beginning 
of 2014 in a civil ceremony in the Warren County Courthouse, Bowling Green. 
They celebrated the marriage in August of the same year with family and friends in 
Rennes, France- where Juliette is from and a later celebration in America in October'`,
